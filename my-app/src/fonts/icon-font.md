# Icon Font

The *ofx-icons* font is generated with [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app)

Use the `selection.json` file to import the Project back into IcoMoon. Make your changes. Export the Font. Update the classes in `_fonts.scss` with the css file provided in the Font Export.

Also replace the files inside the fonts folder with the files in the new exported fonts folder. Converting the woff file to woff2 using an online converter is also required.
